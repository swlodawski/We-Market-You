Marketing Website Code Refactor
I added a Descriptive and Unique Title to the webpage Header Section.
I refactored the existing codebase to include items such as descriptive alt information for the image and icon elements on the webpage.
I ensured the HTML elements met chronlogical and logical standards.
I changed the HTML Tags of some elements using alternative tags to the Div Element and adjustment the CSS Declarations as required to match those changes.
I condensed styling for certain elements based on id and class selectors.
